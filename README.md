This is an advanced project in React that allows you to create a dynamic and interactive Kanban board. However, it currently has several issues that need to be resolved:

1. [Tasks aren't fetched from the server.](https://github.com/developer-job-simulation/react-kanban-board/issues/2)
2. [The application doesn't handle the onDragStart, onDragOver, onDrop, and onDragEnd events.](https://github.com/developer-job-simulation/react-kanban-board/issues/3)
3. [Task changes aren't being stored server side, so changes are lost during refresh.](https://github.com/developer-job-simulation/react-kanban-board/issues/4)

## Learning Objectives

You will learn and gain experience with:

- Implementing drag-and-drop functionality in React by handling various drag events, such as drag start, drag over, and drop.
- Managing application state during drag-and-drop operations to ensure consistent behavior.
- Updating data on the server after making client-side changes.
- Properly resetting application state after each drag-and-drop operation to ensure the UI behaves correctly.
